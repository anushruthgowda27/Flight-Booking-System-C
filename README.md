# Flight and Seat Booking System

This project implements a flight and seat booking system in C, incorporating features such as flight management, seat booking, cancellation, and payment transactions. It uses a binary search tree (BST) to manage flight data and a linked list to maintain seat booking history.

## Features

- **Flight Management**: Add and search flights based on departure time and locations.
- **Seat Booking**: Book and cancel seats in different classes (Economy, Business, First).
- **Payment Transactions**: Record and display payment transactions.
- **Booking History**: Keep track of booking history and display it.
- **Seat Map**: Visual representation of seat availability.

## Tools and Technologies

- **C**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Standard Libraries**: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`.

## Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC).

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile the Program**

   Use a C compiler like GCC to compile the program:
      gcc -o booking_system booking_system.c

## Usage
Flight Management
